# Fully-connected-neural-network-on-numpy
In this task, we will train a fully connected neural network to recognize handwritten numbers by independently implementing all the components of the learning and prediction algorithm: ReLU nonlinearity layer, fully connected layer, gradient checker, softmax layer implementation and loss functions, and some experiments with the number of layers, various initializations of weights, and various activation functions
